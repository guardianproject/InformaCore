Added file metadata to DropboxFileInfo when downloading files (and getting
thumbnails).

 - Saves having to do 2 RPCs to get both the file and its revision.
DropboxFileInfo.getFileSize() is guaranteed to be the file size on file
downloads (and thumbnail requests).
 - Previously, on chunked downloads (if accepting gzip encodings), would be zero.
